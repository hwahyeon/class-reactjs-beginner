# React Fundamentals

This course consists of both **old style(Class-based) and new style(Functional) of React**. I learned the new style course first, so I'll document it first.  

Traces of studying basic theories can be found in these folders
* react-for-beginners
* react-for-beginners-old
* react_app


## Functional

This course has four small projects.
* [Units Converter](https://github.com/hwahyeon/reactjs/tree/main/UnitsConverter)
* [To Do List](https://github.com/hwahyeon/reactjs_small)
* [Coin Tracker](https://github.com/hwahyeon/reactjs_small)
